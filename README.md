## Introduction

Welcome to Yugo Marketplace! 

* My team and I have been working diligently on creating a decentralized marketplace that utilizes blockchain technology to provide a secure and transparent platform for e-commerce. Our platform incorporates Metamask pairing and smart contract interaction to enable seamless transactions through the Ethereum network. We also designed the platform with a user-friendly interface and a stunning design to enhance user experience. We're proud to say that our hard work and dedication have paid off, and we've created a full-fledged Web 3.0 application that empowers users to transact with ease and security. We believe that our platform has the potential to revolutionize the world of e-commerce and are excited to see how it performs in the market.

Challenge
* One of the main challenges we faced was writing Solidity code to create and deploy smart contracts. It required a significant amount of research and testing, but we were able to overcome it with our team's collective expertise and knowledge.
